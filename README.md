# 2.4_tft_lcd_sheild
2.4" touchscreen LCD sheild for arduino uno/mega. Red PCB at time of initial commit.

The libraries and example sketches are simply a crude working version for this sheild. Changes need to be made to correct various things i.e. the touch orientation is incorrect but responsive, some of the colors are incorrect like using 'BLACK' results in white on the display.
