# 2.4_tft_lcd_sheild
2.4" touchscreen LCD sheild for arduino uno/mega. Red PCB at time of initial commit.

Working example sketch for the display (colors and orientation) in 'tanner_red_tft' directory, still working on the touch interface. 

The libraries and example sketches are simply a crude working version for this sheild. Changes need to be made to correct various things i.e. the touch orientation is incorrect but responsive.
